# Plan of Action

---

### Reproduce paper

1. **Paper selection and team formation in Zulip**

2. **Select and register your paper on hackpad**

3. **Work on reproducing the paper!**

4. **Re-group part-way through.**

5. **Feedback at the end (group & authors)**

# Tips for reviewing

---

<!-- Remind participant of code of conduct and basic expectations. Bring attention to the additional considerations involved in giving feedback to authors -->

# Reproduce and Review

---

## Selecting Papers

- **Comments on Papers:** paper description and why you choose to reproduce.
- **Tags:** Tools, languages & research domains

---

## Review as an auditor

### Looking for FAIR principles

- Findable 
- Accessible
- Interoperable
- Reusable

---


## Access

- How easy was it to gain access to the materials?

## Installation

- How easy / automated was installation?
- Did you have any problems?

---

## Data
- Were data clearly separated from code and other items?
- Were large data files deposited in a trustworthy data repository and referred to using a persistent identifier?
- Were data documented ...somehow...

---


## Documentation

Was there adequate documentation describing:
- how to install necessary data/analysis/software?
- how to use materials to reproduce the paper?
- how to cite the materials, ideally in a form that can be copy and pasted?

---

## Analysis

- Were you able to fully reproduce the paper? 
- How automated was the process of reproducing the paper?
- How easy was it to link analysis code to:
    - the plots it generates
    - sections in the manuscript in which it is described

---

## Analysis

### If the analysis was not fully reproducible 
- Did results (e.g. model outputs, tables, figures) differ to those published? By how much?
- Were missing dependencies?
- Was the computational environment not adequately described / captured?

## 1. Paper review / Team formation

+ Have a look at the papers available for reproduction
+ Add your details to the **hackpad**.
+ Fine to work individually or tackle a papers as group

---

## 2. Project registration

+ Register your team and paper on the **hackpad**
+ Connect with people who want to work on the same paper.

---

## 3. Reproduce Paper

- Try to reproduce the paper using the materials provided.
- Record your responses to review questions according to your experiences.

---

## 4. Mid-point regroup

- Which paper have you selected? Briefly describe what it's about.
- Briefly describe the approach to reproducibility the paper has taken.
- Anything in particular you like about the paper's approach so far?
- Anything you're having difficulty with?

---

## 5. Feedback to authors

- **Please complete the feedback form for authors**
- Feel free to record general findings the hackpad

---

## 6. Final regroup

- So, how did you get on? 
- Final comments.
- On hackMD: One thing you liked, one thing that can be improved.
